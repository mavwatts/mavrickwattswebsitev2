            <p class='section__title portfolio__title'>Fossil has always been inspired by American creativity and ingenuity. Since 1984, we've strived to bring new life into the industry by making quality, fashionable watched and accessories that were both fun and accessible.Today, we continue to focus on what makes us optimistic, authentic and creative.</p>

                <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
                <br>
                <div class='portfolio-item-description'>
                <p>For this project my focus was on creating an 'ad page' that displayed fossils new line of watches in a unique way as well as gave just a glimpse at fossils new smart watches in an ad like manner. I accomplished this by utilizing a little bit of Javascript for functionality to display the watches the user selected while making the remainder of the site static but asthetically pleasing to view for the Fossils watch info.</p></div><br><br>

                <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
                <br>
                <div class='portfolio-item-description'>
                <p>A minor challenge that I had with this page was getting the smaller watch selection to switch to the bigger watch area on the right side of the page. I was able to solve this by creating a simple function targeting the bigger watch and setting the smaller watches to an onclick that swaps them out as they are selected.</p>

                <h3>THE SOLUTION</h3>
                <br>
                <div class='portfolio-item-description'>
                <p>The solution for creating this ad site was to come up with a plan to:</p><br> 
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Display the new line of watches</li>
                    <li>2. Give insight into the new line of smart watches</li>
                    <li>3. Display the information provided in a aesthetically pleasing manner.</li>
                </ul>  
                <br>
                <p>I focused on displaying a few watches right on the landing hero section to allow users to hover over watches they were interested in using Javascript. The wood background serves no significant meaning other than to bring attention to the watches and the font colors easier. For the info provided on the new line of smart watches I came up with the idea of giving it an 'ad feel' by making the images and writing go side by side in a grid down the site. I spaced everything out so that the info wasn't too cluttered together and easier to digest. Towards the bottom on the last section I wanted to focus on the CCO's quote on their new hybrid watches while showing just a glimpse of them in the background. This was intentional as the main focus was on her statement rather than the hybrid watch which was displayed further up above. Lastly I wanted to incorporate social media to bring awareness to Fossil's brand which I displayed on the side at the top and the bottom of the footer section.</p></div>
